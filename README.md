# **PIT FIGHTER**
### A FIGHTING GAME ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL KIDS FIGHTING IN THE SMOKE PIT
_AIDAN SMALLBONE 2017_

## CREATING THE GAME

THIS GAME IS MY FINAL PROJECT FOR A PROGRAMMING 3U CLASS.

THE GAME WILL BE WRITTEN USING **C#** AND **XNA**, AND **VISUAL STUDIO 2017** AS AN IDE.

ALL ART ASSETS WERE CREATED USING A COMBINATION OF **ASESPRITE** AND **PHOTOSHOP CC**.

THE GAME IS TO BE USED IN AN ARCADE CABINET WITH A RESOLUTION OF _1024x768_, SO ALL OF THE ASSETS WILL BE CREATED AT _256x192_ AND SCALED UP IN PHOTOSHOP TO GIVE THE GAME A RETRO LOOK.

## GAME FEATURES/MECHANICS

**CONTROLS:** SUPPORT FOR KEYBOARD CONTROLS AS WELL AS XINPUT FOR XBOX 360/XBOX ONE WIRED CONTROLLERS

**STAGES:** TO BEGIN WITH, THE GAME WILL FEATURE 2 UNIQUE STAGES WITH EXCLUSIVE POWERUPS AND MECHANICS DEPENDING ON THE STAGE, BUT I PLAN TO ADD MORE IN TIME.

**CHARACTERS:** THE GAME WILL FEATURE 9 CHARACTERS WITH DIFFERENT STATS AND ABILITIES, HOWEVER THE USE WILL NOT KNOW WHICH CHARACTERS HAVE WHAT ABILTIES (MEANING THEY'LL HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME TO FIGURE IT OUT)

**MOVES:** THE CHARACTERS WILL ALL HAVE A PUNCH AND KICK, IN HEAVY AND LIGHT VARIANTS. THERE WILL ALSO BE A SPECIAL ABILITY WHICH CAN BE UNLOCKED BY DOING WELL IN A ROUND

**SPECIALS:** CHARACTERS WILL HAVE A SPECIAL BAR AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN WHICH WILL KEEP TRACK OF HOW WELL THEY'RE DOING, AND IF THE CHARACTER IS DOING WELL SPECIAL POWERUPS WILL BE DROPPED WHICH CAN UNLOCK THEIR SPECIAL

**PLANNED ADDITIONAL FEATURES:** SEEING AS I HAVE A DEADLINE SET FOR THIS GAME TO BE IN WORKING ORDER, SOME FEATURES MIGHT BE MISSING UPON INITIAL RELEASE, AND AS TIME GOES ON ADDITIONAL FEATURES/CHARACTERS/STAGES MIGHT BE ADDED DEPENDING ON HOW THE INITAL RELEASE IS RECIEVED AND HOW MUCH SPARE TIME I HAVE :D

## CURRENT PROGRESS

I WILL UPDATE THIS SECTION AS WORK GETS DONE, BUT THE COMMIT NOTES WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT WHAT I'VE DONE SO FAR.
